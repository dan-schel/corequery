# CoreQuery

## Architecture TODO

To prove it works:

- Setup express server
- Setup server to serve frontend
- Setup demo app
- Script to create demo app from external git repo
- Setup PWA
- Some mechanism to inject stuff into the built Vite project (i.e. for the App name in the navbar, PWA manifest, etc.)

For the real deal:

- Setup linting with ESLint and TSC
- Setup Prisma, and check it can easily swap between PostgreSQL and SQLite.
- Setup Prettier
- Setup unit tests
- Setup renovate
- Setup CI
