# CoreQuery

A platform for building web apps serving transit information. (Work in progress!)

## Setup TODO

- Use loose versioning (i.e. `^`) for dependencies (dev dependencies can still be pinned) and configure Renovate to handle it.
- Setup TailwindCSS
- Setup TypeORM, and check it can easily swap between PostgreSQL and SQLite.
- Public the `trainquery-melbourne` repo, add formatting, linting, etc. scripts, and add CI and renovate.
